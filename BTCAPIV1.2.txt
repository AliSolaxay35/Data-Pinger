This Python script monitors the current price of Bitcoin(BTC) in USD using the CoinGecko API.

If the current price drops below the threshold defined in the variable 'my_good_price'(e.g., 200000 USD),a custom alert function 'inform_AS35WLT()' is triggered.
This function displays a notification message indicating the price drop.

Key Features:
- Retrieves real-time BTC price from the CoinGecko public API.
- Uses a modular approach by defining a separate notification function.
- Easily configurable price threshold.

Requirements:
- Internet connection
- Python 'requests' library(install via 'pip install requests')

Usage: 
1. Set the desired threshold in the 'my_good_price' variable.
2. Run the script with a Python interpreter.
3. If BTC price is below the defined threshold,an alert message will be printed.

This script is suitable for basic Bitcoin price alerting or as a starting point for building more advanced crypto monitoring systems.

Thank You.
